ROLLING SUM
===========
Count the summary of the latest N numbers with constant time complexity O(1).

### How to run the test:
From the project's root directory, run below commands:
```
cmake -S . -B <build_directory>
cmake --build <build_directory>

ctest --test-dir <build_directory>/test
```

### TODO:
- ☑ use standard C++ project structure for library ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13521618/c-project-organisation-with-gtest-cmake-and-doxygen))
- ☐ tidy the tests (should we?)
